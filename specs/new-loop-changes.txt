Model strategy system (model-strategy.md) - COMPLETE. All R1-R11 tasks implemented and passing tests. CLI flags, Config fields, all four strategies (fixed, cost-optimized, escalate, plan-then-execute), Claude hint parsing, system prompt documentation, override logging, and --model flag integration all working.

Config.md R1-R3 DONE: Added src/project.rs with ProjectConfig discovery, RalphConfig/SpecsConfig/PromptsConfig structs with serde, defaults (.ralph/specs, .ralph/prompts), toml parsing with forward-compat. All 9 tests passing.

Config.md R4 DONE: Implemented `ralph init` subcommand. Creates .ralph.toml (commented defaults), .ralph/ directory structure (prompts/, specs/, progress.db), and .gitignore entry. Idempotent: skips existing .ralph.toml, appends to .gitignore without duplicates. Added Command subcommand enum to CLI, wired into main.rs. All 103 tests passing.

Config.md R5 DONE: Removed --specs-dir/RALPH_SPECS_DIR and --progress-file/RALPH_PROGRESS_FILE CLI flags from Args. Updated Config struct to remove progress_file and specs_dir fields, added project_root and ralph_config fields. Changed Config::from_args signature to accept ProjectConfig. Updated main.rs to call project::discover() before Config creation. Updated run_loop.rs to derive progress_db path from project_root. Fixed all test helpers in config.rs, cli.rs, claude/client.rs, and strategy.rs to use new ProjectConfig. All 103 tests passing.
