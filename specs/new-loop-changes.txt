CLI flags, Config fields, all four strategies (fixed, cost-optimized, escalate, plan-then-execute), Claude hint parsing, system prompt documentation, override logging, and --model flag integration all working.

Config.md R1-R3 DONE: Added src/project.rs with ProjectConfig discovery, RalphConfig/SpecsConfig/PromptsConfig structs with serde, defaults (.ralph/specs, .ralph/prompts), toml parsing with forward-compat. All 9 tests passing.
