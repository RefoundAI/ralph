### Completed in This Loop:
- loop-changes.md R4: DAG-driven loop implementation (open DB, claim tasks, handle sigils)
- loop-changes.md R5: Cleanup old progress file logic
- loop-changes.md R6: Colored iteration display (cyan task IDs, green/red status)

ALL of loop-changes.md (R1-R7) is now COMPLETE.
dag-tracker.md (R1-R8) appears COMPLETE based on code structure and tests.

### Next Steps:
The next iteration should focus on ONE of these:
1. **system-prompt.md R1-R5** - System prompt restructuring for DAG support (R6 already done as part of earlier work)
2. **cli-restructure.md R1** - Start CLI subcommand restructuring (Subcommand enum + R1 implementation)
3. OR verify/document dag-tracker.md completion status

Recommend starting with system-prompt.md R1-R5 as it's more critical for DAG integration than CLI restructuring.

**R4 (this iteration)**: Implemented build_task_context function with comprehensive tests. All 195 tests pass.

**R2 (this iteration)**: Rewrote build_system_prompt to remove all progress file references and add DAG task assignment instructions. Added <task-done> and <task-failed> sigil documentation. All 196 tests pass.
