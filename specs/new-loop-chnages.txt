R1: Implemented SQLite schema with tasks, dependencies, and task_logs tables. WAL mode, foreign key constraints, and schema versioning via user_version pragma. All unit tests passing.
R2: Implemented task ID generation (t-XXXXXX format) using SHA-256 hash of timestamp+counter. Collision retry logic with max 10 attempts. Added sha2 dependency to Cargo.toml. All unit tests passing (137 total).
R3: Implemented task hierarchy with derived parent status. Created src/dag/tasks.rs with compute_parent_status() and get_task_status() functions. Parent status computed recursively from children: failed > done > in_progress > pending. All unit tests passing (143 total).

R4: Implemented dependency management with cycle detection. Created src/dag/dependencies.rs with add_dependency() and remove_dependency(). BFS-based cycle detection rejects direct, transitive, and longer cycles. All 8 unit tests passing (151 total).

R5: Implemented ready query in get_ready_tasks(). Returns pending leaf tasks where all blockers are done and parent is not failed. Ordered by priority ASC, created_at ASC. All 7 unit tests passing (158 total).
[model-override] iteration=6 strategy_choice=opus hint=sonnet
R6: Implemented status transitions with validation and auto-transitions. Created src/dag/transitions.rs with set_task_status(), auto_unblock_tasks(), auto_complete_parent(), and auto_fail_parent(). Valid transitions enforced: pending->in_progress/blocked, in_progress->done/failed/pending, blocked->pending, failed->pending. Auto-unblock fires when blocker completes, auto-complete-parent when all children done, auto-fail-parent when child fails. Implemented claim_task(), complete_task(), fail_task(), all_resolved(), release_claim(), and get_task_counts(). All 170 unit tests passing.
